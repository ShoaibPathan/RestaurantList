# RestaurantList
A sample iOS app in swift listing restaurants with filter and sort options.
Here, I make use of:
* APIClient that encapsulates all external input and communication, to allow for easier testing.
* A Model layer that can (and should) be encapsulated into a module with tests behind APIClient.
* Simple UIViewController testing.
* Generic DataStore.
